    "This code is focused on generating and adding various features to two DataFrames (`train_series` and `test_series`) based on different time windows and data transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `features, feature_cols = [pl.col('hour')], ['hour']`: This line initializes two lists, `features` and `feature_cols`. It starts with one feature, which is the 'hour' column, and one feature column name 'hour'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `for mins in [5, 30, 60*2, 60*8]:`: This is the beginning of a loop that iterates over different time window durations specified in minutes (5, 30, 120, and 480).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `features += [...]`: This line appends new features to the `features` list. For each time window duration (`mins`), it calculates the following features for the 'enmo' column:\n",
    "   - Rolling mean with a window of 12 times the specified minutes (`12 * mins`) using `pl.col('enmo').rolling_mean(...)`.\n",
    "   - Rolling maximum with the same window using `pl.col('enmo').rolling_max(...)`.\n",
    "   It then casts these features to 16-bit unsigned integers and assigns aliases with the format 'enmo_Xm_mean' and 'enmo_Xm_max', where X is the time window duration in minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `feature_cols += [...]`: This line appends the corresponding feature column names to the `feature_cols` list, which are 'enmo_Xm_mean' and 'enmo_Xm_max' for each time window duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The same steps are repeated for the 'anglez' column, resulting in features named 'anglez_Xm_mean' and 'anglez_Xm_max' for each time window duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `id_cols = ['series_id', 'step', 'timestamp']`: This line defines a list of columns to keep in the final DataFrame. These columns are 'series_id', 'step', and 'timestamp'.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `train_series = train_series.with_columns(features).select(id_cols + feature_cols)`: This line adds the calculated features to the `train_series` DataFrame using the `with_columns` method and then selects only the columns specified in `id_cols` and `feature_cols`. This effectively updates `train_series` with the newly generated features.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `test_series = test_series.with_columns(features).select(id_cols + feature_cols)`: Similar to the previous line, this line adds the same calculated features to the `test_series` DataFrame and selects the specified columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code generates features based on rolling statistics (mean and max) for both the 'enmo' and 'anglez' columns, with different time window durations. It then updates the `train_series` and `test_series` DataFrames with these calculated features while keeping the specified identifier and feature columns. This process is common in feature engineering for machine learning tasks, where additional features are created from existing data to improve model performance."

    "This Python function, `make_train_dataset`, is designed to create a training dataset from raw data, which includes both feature data (`train_data`) and event information (`train_events`). It returns feature data `X` and target labels `y` for training our machine learning model.:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `series_ids = train_data['series_id'].unique(maintain_order=True).to_list()`: This line extracts unique 'series_id' values from the `train_data` DataFrame while maintaining the original order and converts them to a Python list. These unique series identifiers will be used to process data for each individual series.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `X, y = pl.DataFrame(), pl.DataFrame()`: This line initializes two empty DataFrames, `X` for features and `y` for target labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `for idx in tqdm(series_ids):`: This loop iterates through each unique 'series_id' in the `series_ids` list, using `tqdm` to display a progress bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `sample = train_data.filter(...)`: Within the loop, this line filters the `train_data` DataFrame to obtain the data for the current 'series_id'. It then normalizes the selected columns (except 'hour') by dividing each column by its standard deviation and casting the result as a 32-bit floating-point number (Float32).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `events = train_events.filter(...)`: This line filters the `train_events` DataFrame to obtain the events data for the current 'series_id'.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `if drop_nulls: ...`: If the `drop_nulls` parameter is set to `True`, this section removes data points in the `sample` DataFrame that correspond to dates where no events were recorded. It does this by filtering the `sample` DataFrame based on matching dates between `sample` and `events` using the 'timestamp' column.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `X = X.vstack(...)`: This line vertically stacks the current 'sample' DataFrame onto the existing 'X' DataFrame, combining the features for multiple series.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `onsets = events.filter(...)`: This line extracts the 'step' values corresponding to 'onset' events from the 'events' DataFrame and stores them in the `onsets` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `wakeups = events.filter(...)`: Similar to the previous line, this extracts the 'step' values corresponding to 'wakeup' events and stores them in the `wakeups` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. `y = y.vstack(...)`: This line constructs target labels ('asleep') based on the 'onsets' and 'wakeups' values. It checks for each data point in 'sample' if it falls within any sleep interval defined by 'onset' and 'wakeup' events, and casts the result as a Boolean value. The resulting labels are stacked vertically onto the 'y' DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. `y = y.to_numpy().ravel()`: After processing all series, this line converts the 'y' DataFrame to a NumPy array and flattens it to a 1D array. This is typically done to match the format expected by many machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Finally, the function returns `X` (the feature matrix) and `y` (the target labels) as the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function takes raw feature data and event information, processes them for each series, and creates a dataset suitable for training machine learning models. It provides a way to drop null data points if desired and generates target labels based on sleep event information."

    "   - `'num_leaves'`: This parameter controls the number of leaves (terminal nodes) in each tree in the gradient boosting model. A higher value can make the model more expressive, but it can also lead to overfitting if set too high.\n",
    "   - `'learning_rate'`: This parameter determines the step size at each iteration during the gradient boosting process. A smaller learning rate often requires more iterations but can result in a better-performing model.\n",
    "   - `'random_state'`: This parameter sets the random seed for reproducibility. It ensures that the same results are obtained when the model is trained with the same data and hyperparameters.\n",

    "2. `my_classifier = lgb.LGBMClassifier(**lgb_opt)`: This line creates an instance of the LightGBM classifier with the specified hyperparameters (`lgb_opt`). The double asterisks (`**`) are used to unpack the dictionary `lgb_opt` and pass its contents as keyword arguments to the `LGBMClassifier` constructor. This initializes the classifier with the specified hyperparameters.\n",

    "   - `X_train[feature_cols]`: This is the feature matrix used for training. It selects only the columns specified in `feature_cols`, which typically represent the features used for prediction.\n",
    "   - `y_train`: This is the target labels or ground truth values corresponding to the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `fit` method is called to train the classifier using the specified features and target labels. During training, the LightGBM algorithm will iteratively build an ensemble of decision trees, optimizing their structure to minimize a specified loss function. The trained model (`my_classifier`) can then be used for making predictions on new data.\n",

    "2. `submission.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)`: This line saves the DataFrame named `submission` to a CSV file named 'submission.csv'. Here's what each part of the code does:\n",
    "   - `submission`: This is the DataFrame containing the sleep event predictions generated using the test data.\n",
    "   - `.to_csv(...)`: This is a method call on the DataFrame that exports the data to a CSV file. The parameters are as follows:\n",
    "      - `'submission.csv'`: This specifies the name of the CSV file to which the DataFrame will be saved.\n",
    "      - `index=False`: This parameter indicates that the DataFrame's index (row numbers) should not be included in the CSV file. When `index` is set to `False`, the CSV file will not have an extra column for row numbers.\n",

    "In summary, this code segment applies a trained LightGBM classifier to the test data to predict sleep events, collects these predictions into a DataFrame named `submission`, and then saves this DataFrame to a CSV file named 'submission.csv'. The resulting CSV file can be used for submission in a machine learning competition or for further analysis."
